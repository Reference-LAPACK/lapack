*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  This routine is not for general use.  It exists solely to avoid
*  over-optimization in SISNAN.
*
*  SLAISNAN checks for NaNs by comparing its two arguments for
*  inequality.  NaN is the only floating-point value where NaN != NaN
*  returns .TRUE.  To check for NaNs, pass the same variable as both
*  arguments.
*
*  A compiler must assume that the two arguments are
*  not the same variable, and the test will not be optimized away.
*  Interprocedural or whole-program optimization may delete this
*  test.  The ISNAN functions will be replaced by the correct
*  Fortran 03 intrinsic once the intrinsic is widely available.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  SIN1     (input) REAL
*  SIN2     (input) REAL
*          Two numbers to compare for inequality.
